# Release Notes

This is the first `m4b-tool` release after 5 years, so expect lots of changes and improvements. The release process is now automated via github actions and therefore versions can be published more regularly.

The purpose of this `0.5.0` release is to bring `m4b-tool` up to the latest improvements, dependencies and make it compatible with more recent PHP versions.
